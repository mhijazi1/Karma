# Karma 

Karma is an image recognition software built using the Clarifai API. The goal is to take images of a car and quickly assess damage. 

This project is intended to take the [desktop version](http://devpost.com/software/ugahacksrepo) and convert it into a web app. 

The desktop version was part of the [UGAHacks](http://ugahacks.devpost.com/) hackathon and won for best use of the [Clarifai API](https://github.com/Clarifai/hackathon.git).

Please note that this project uses [Clarifai's custom training API](https://github.com/Clarifai/hackathon.git) which is still in alpha.
